            Hi, my names is Veronica pla. I am 17 years old, I'm going into my senior year of high school, and I live in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I don't know much about technology but I wanted to take this class to learn something new that will help me in the future. I like to play tennis with my friends and family for fun and go to the beach. Since I live in an island beach activities and sports are really popular so me and my family love to go on road trips along the island and go surfing or play beach tennis and beach volleyball. My favorite TV show right now is "Las chicas del cable"
