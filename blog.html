        <h2>Descrabble Game by Veronica, Bonsitu, and Margarita</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla /July 21, 2023</p>
        <p>This game challenges your deciphiring capabilities in a fun way. This game can be played in different ways. There are three different piles of cards and each pile is a different difficulty. The easy pile has five letters words with a key of 3 (A=D), the medium pile has six letter words and a key of 7 (B=I), and the hard pile has seven letter words with a key of 9 (C=L). This is a competitive game so you have to try to decipher and scrabble the word faster than your oppononent. One way you can play this game in ways, the first way is both of the players get the same word. The first step is deciphiring the letters in the card that you picked and then scrabble the letters until you guess the word. The first one to guess the word correctly keeps the card and wins a point. The winner is the player that finished with the most cards. The second way is you have the three piles of cards infront of both players and you put a 3 minute timer. You need to try and decipher the most words possible before the timer ends. The player with most cards wins the game.

        </p>
        <p>There was a challenge in figuring out how many letters and keys the levels should be, but we decided on 5 letters for easy and a key of 3 for easy, 6 letters for mediumm and a key of 7, and 7 letter words and a key of 9 for hard. Also, when we tested the game with one of the instructor she had trouble in deciphering the letters and suggested we put the normal alphabet and then the altered alphabet. We thought about it and realized that doing that would take away the competitive part of the game so we came to the conclusion of giving the key (ex: A=D).

        <h2>Geneveive Grotjan's Work</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla / July 18, 2023</p>
        <p>
            The work of Genevieve Grotjan, a skilled cryptanalyst, helped changed the course of history. At the time many women were getting recruited at schools, colleges, universities, and various other positions with the sole purpose of breaking codes for the U.S. Government. Her and many other recruited women lived and worked at Arlington Farm in Virginia. These women were hailed from their hometowns to come live in Virginia and were told to never tell anyone about their work. History barely notices the work they did, which was very important, and in most cases not even their families knew about their work. 
        </p>
        <p>She was hired to work for the Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) by William Friedman in 1939. In 1940 she was able to note patterns, repetitions, and cycles used in intercepted transmissions that help break the “Purple” code, a cipher used by Japan during WWII to code diplomatic messages to various embassies through the world, the SIS used an analog machine that they built using the information that Grotjan came across to break the Japanese cipher. William Friedman said that the breaking of the “Purple” cipher provided “the most important source of strategically valuable, long-term intelligence” as the war was fast becoming reality for the United States. During WWII, this system’s exploitation supplied important intelligence in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. She was later assigned to the Soviet problem in October 1943 where she worked with the project Venona. This project’s mission was to decipher messages sent by Soviet spy organizations and study and utilize Soviet diplomatic communications.
