        <h2>STRONG Museum</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla / July 27, 2023</p>

        <p>Yesterday we were able to go to the Strong Museum in Rochester, New York. There we met with Rachel who gave us a mini tour of the museum and then she took us to a conference room so that we could do the activity that she had planed for us. The activity was digging up different pieces of history having to do with women in technology and in games. The piece of history that I “dug up” was Tomb Raider PC Game (1997) when the archeologist Lara Croft was introduced to the game. For the first part of the activity, we had to assume the connection our piece of history had with women. I assumed that the 1997 version of Lara Croft was completely designed by men for men. There’s no way a woman would design such an unrealistic female character. The second part of the activity we had to find a person who dug up a similar piece of history and connect them to make an “exhibition”. I found that Deborah had found the 2013 version of Lara Croft. She assumed that women had leading roles in video games, that she went against societies standards, and that she was able to have her own backstory without a man being present. We also noticed together that the two versions were very different. The 1997 version had a very unrealistic physical appearance (her clothes and her figure) and the 2013 version had more realistic characteristics. In this part of the activity, we had to create a logo for the exhibition and a small description of both artifacts. For the description we decided to talk about the fact that through the span of 16 years Lara Croft’s image changed from the male gaze (1997) to a realistic viewpoint (2013) and she was given a meaningful backstory making her a more important character. We also stated that her attire changed, in 1997 she wore a very unfitting outfit for exploring and in 2013 her outfit was more explorer type. For the logo, we mixed both versions of Lara Croft, the left half is the 1997 version and the right half is the 2013 version so her evolution can be more noticeable. The musuem itself was really fun. I really liked all the vintage arcade games and that we could actually play them. I loved the Sesame Street part and I spent like an hour in there and in the tiny supermarket. </p>

        <h2>J.A.R.V.I.S.</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla / July 25, 2023</p>

        <p>My favorite AI character is J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) from Iron Man. He is my favorite because I’ve always been a fan of the Marvel franchise and J.A.R.V.I.S. always had like a comedic relief to the movie. I also liked when he became Vision because even though he was a machine created by a man as more movies came out (years in the franchise) he started developing feelings and acting more and more as a human. I like that part, but it also freaks me out because, although it is a fictional world, it’s a literal robot creating his own thoughts and emotions, it’s a robot that acts as a human. That is creepy but cool. I obviously knew that the robot, Ray, was not going to be like J.A.R.V.I.S./Vision, but I thought it was cool that her face could change and that she had a whole introduction ready for us. Thinking about robots now I guess it’s a bit less interesting because before I always thought about robots like in the movies with their own minds and taking over the world, and obviously that’s not happening right now. Now I know that most of them are not like that even though we only saw two examples (Ray and Midjourney AI). It also creeps me out that with AI you can fake a complete person and pretend that they’re your friend, or that you can blame things on other people and create evidence with AI. You can also fake voices and pretend you’re someone else or create fake songs, which has been a very popular trend on TikTok. I don’t like the idea of robots one day being everywhere, but I guess that that’s going to be the future so I’m going to have to get used to it, but not yet.</p>

        <h2>Descrabble Game by Veronica, Bonsitu, and Margarita</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla /July 21, 2023</p>
        <p>This game challenges your deciphiring capabilities in a fun way. This game can be played in different ways. There are three different piles of cards and each pile is a different difficulty. The easy pile has five letters words with a key of 3 (A=D), the medium pile has six letter words and a key of 7 (B=I), and the hard pile has seven letter words with a key of 9 (C=L). This is a competitive game so you have to try to decipher and scrabble the word faster than your oppononent. One way you can play this game in ways, the first way is both of the players get the same word. The first step is deciphiring the letters in the card that you picked and then scrabble the letters until you guess the word. The first one to guess the word correctly keeps the card and wins a point. The winner is the player that finished with the most cards. The second way is you have the three piles of cards infront of both players and you put a 3 minute timer. You need to try and decipher the most words possible before the timer ends. The player with most cards wins the game.

        </p>
        <p>There was a challenge in figuring out how many letters and keys the levels should be, but we decided on 5 letters for easy and a key of 3 for easy, 6 letters for mediumm and a key of 7, and 7 letter words and a key of 9 for hard. Also, when we tested the game with one of the instructor she had trouble in deciphering the letters and suggested we put the normal alphabet and then the altered alphabet. We thought about it and realized that doing that would take away the competitive part of the game so we came to the conclusion of giving the key (ex: A=D).

        <h2>Geneveive Grotjan's Work</h2>
        <p>Veronica Pla / July 18, 2023</p>
        <p>
            The work of Genevieve Grotjan, a skilled cryptanalyst, helped changed the course of history. At the time many women were getting recruited at schools, colleges, universities, and various other positions with the sole purpose of breaking codes for the U.S. Government. Her and many other recruited women lived and worked at Arlington Farm in Virginia. These women were hailed from their hometowns to come live in Virginia and were told to never tell anyone about their work. History barely notices the work they did, which was very important, and in most cases not even their families knew about their work. 
        </p>
        <p>She was hired to work for the Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) by William Friedman in 1939. In 1940 she was able to note patterns, repetitions, and cycles used in intercepted transmissions that help break the “Purple” code, a cipher used by Japan during WWII to code diplomatic messages to various embassies through the world, the SIS used an analog machine that they built using the information that Grotjan came across to break the Japanese cipher. William Friedman said that the breaking of the “Purple” cipher provided “the most important source of strategically valuable, long-term intelligence” as the war was fast becoming reality for the United States. During WWII, this system’s exploitation supplied important intelligence in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. She was later assigned to the Soviet problem in October 1943 where she worked with the project Venona. This project’s mission was to decipher messages sent by Soviet spy organizations and study and utilize Soviet diplomatic communications.
