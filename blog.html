            The work of Genevieve Grotjan, a skilled cryptanalyst, helped changed the course of history. At the time many women were getting recruited at schools, colleges, universities, and various other positions with the sole purpose of breaking codes for the U.S. Government. Her and many other recruited women lived and worked at Arlington Farm in Virginia. These women were hailed from their hometowns to come live in Virginia and were told to never tell anyone about their work. History barely notices the work they did, which was very important, and in most cases not even their families knew about their work.

        <p>She was hired to work for the Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) by William Friedman in 1939. In 1940 she was able to note patterns, repetitions, and cycles used in intercepted transmissions that help break the “Purple” code, a cipher used by Japan during WWII to code diplomatic messages to various embassies through the world, the SIS used an analog machine that they built using the information that Grotjan came across to break the Japanese cipher. William Friedman said that the breaking of the “Purple” cipher provided “the most important source of strategically valuable, long-term intelligence” as the war was fast becoming reality for the United States. During WWII, this system’s exploitation supplied important intelligence in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. She was later assigned to the Soviet problem in October 1943 where she worked with the project Venona. This project’s mission was to decipher messages sent by Soviet spy organizations and study and utilize Soviet diplomatic communications.
